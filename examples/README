Examples of how to use rjgtoys.yaml

Run the script example.py as follows:

   python example.py example1.yaml

Repeat for the other example*.yaml

The first three examples show inclusion of data from other files,
merging the data from the previous example files.

The final example, example4.yaml, shows the effect of including
a directory.

Note that when the data is dumped, order of keys is preserved.
